This project is based on these main resources:

DeepMind's Oct 19th publication: Mastering the Game of Go without Human Knowledge.
The great Reversi development of the DeepMind ideas that @mokemokechicken did in his repo: https://github.com/mokemokechicken/reversi-alpha-zero
DeepMind just released a new version of AlphaGo Zero (named now AlphaZero) where they master chess from scratch: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf. In fact, in chess AlphaZero outperformed Stockfish after just 4 hours (300k steps) Wow!
