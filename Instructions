How to use
Setup
install libraries

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to use GPU, follow these instructions to install with pip3.

Make sure Keras is using Tensorflow and you have Python 3.6.3+. Depending on your environment, you may have to run python3/pip3 instead of python/pip.

Basic Usage
For training model, execute Self-Play, Trainer and Evaluator.

Note: Make sure you are running the scripts from the top-level directory of this repo, i.e. python src/chess_zero/run.py opt, not python run.py opt.

Self-Play

python src/chess_zero/run.py self

When executed, Self-Play will start using BestModel. If the BestModel does not exist, new random model will be created and become BestModel.

options
--new: create new BestModel
--type mini: use mini config for testing, (see src/chess_zero/configs/mini.py)
Trainer
python src/chess_zero/run.py opt
When executed, Training will start. A base model will be loaded from latest saved next-generation model. If not existed, BestModel is used. Trained model will be saved every epoch.

options
--type mini: use mini config for testing, (see src/chess_zero/configs/mini.py)
--total-step: specify total step(mini-batch) numbers. The total step affects learning rate of training.
Evaluator
python src/chess_zero/run.py eval
When executed, Evaluation will start. It evaluates BestModel and the latest next-generation model by playing about 200 games. If next-generation model wins, it becomes BestModel.

options
--type mini: use mini config for testing, (see src/chess_zero/configs/mini.py)
